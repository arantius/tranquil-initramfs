Required Kernel Options for ZFS
======================
- Linux Kernel
  ZLIB_INFLATE/ZLIB_DEFLATE can be compiled as a module but must be declared
  in the 'mods' variable in pkg/hooks/addon.py (Used for ZFS)
  * If you don't compile these modules (or load them), you will get an
    "unknown symbol" error when zfs is attempted to be used at boot.
  * ZLIB_DEFLATE cannot be told to be compiled in directly. You need to look
    at the ZLIB_DEFLATE dependencies (Do a search inside of menuconfig), and
    make sure that one of the conditions are all set to be built in.

This an effort to collect all dependencies (and attempting to document any
hidden ones) needed for you to compile a minimal kernel that supports booting
your rootfs on ZFS. Usually the generic kernels from distributions work because
they have enough things compiled in that all of the dependencies are already
taken into account.

If you find any more, email me so I can include them in this list.

Required Kernel Options for Initramfs Support
======================
  General setup --->
  > [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
    () Initramfs source file(s)

Required Kernel Options for LUKS
======================
  Device Drivers --->
  > Generic Driver Options --->
    [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
    [*] Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs
  > [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
    <*> Device mapper support
    <*> Crypt target support

  Cryptographic API --->
  * Any ciphers you need in order to unlock your encrypted drive should be
    enabled as either a module or built into the kernel.

Other
======================
  * All other drivers required to see your PATA/SATA drives (or USB devices)
    need to be compiled in or you can compile them as a module and declare
    them in the 'mods' variable in pkg/hooks/addon.py.
